  #     As a visitor
  #     When I visit any page with an item on it
  #     I should see a link or button for "Add to Cart"
  #     When I click "Add to cart" for that item
  #     And I click a link or button to view cart
  #     And my current path should be "/cart"
  #     And I should see a small image, title, description and price for the item I just added
  #     And there should be a "total" price for the cart that should be the sum of all items in the cart
