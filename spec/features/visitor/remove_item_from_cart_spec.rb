# issueFive:
#     title: Removing an item from my cart
#     body: >
#       Background: My cart has an item in it
#       As a visitor
#       When I visit "/cart"
#       And I click link "Remove"
#       Then my current page should be "/cart"
#       And I should see a message styled in green
#       And the message should say "Successfully removed SOME_ITEM from your cart."
#       And the title "SOME_ITEM" should be a link to that item in case the user wants to add it back
#       And I should not see the item listed in cart
